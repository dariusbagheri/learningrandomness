# learningrandomness
Make sense of randomness,

Data comes from a guessing game computer plays against itself,  choosing a random number then trying to guess the random number by guessing a series of random numbers
then record a 4-dimensional array of number of migger, smaller, and tries to guess the chosen number as feature and the chosen number as the label.

It is a model to check if Nueral Networks can predict Randomness or we can create a model to predict random numbers
if we can change the Hypoprameters to come up with a model or a ne model, try prove Einestine was right and God don't play dice with universe,
